starting this so I have a running commentary on my changes and funny things I notice happening
in my code

today's discovery: the first version of the init_diag_value_matrix was messing with the execution
of the pvr_set_bg_color() function. originally, the function worked properly with the init_identity() matrix
function. at first i thought it was simply an emulator bug but it seemed suspicious that a single function 
would cause display corruption like that. additionally the bfont_draw_str_vram_fmt function still works
properly and displays the memory address of the dcm_file_hdr.version struct element consistently, so 
i ruled out the emulator.

i've since transposed the header and inline functions to C++ alongside main and am now reworking the diagonal
matrix loading function

changes:
	main.c   -> main.cpp
	matrix.h -> matrix.hpp
	removed contents of init_diag_value_matrix
	transposed init_identity() to C++ style inline asm

results:
	program still compiles and displays screen background color correctly

tbd: 
	complete diagonal value matrix with correct formatting and instructions
